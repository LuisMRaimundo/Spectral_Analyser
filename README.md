# SoundSpectrAnalyse

SoundSpectrAnalyse is a spectral-analysis pipeline developed in support of doctoral research in musicology at NOVA University of Lisbon, with a focus on musical texture in twentieth-century repertoire. The instrument analyses individual note recordings and produces an auditable per-note and corpus-level decomposition of spectral content into harmonic, inharmonic, and sub-bass components (H/I/S), supplemented by a battery of psychoacoustic and MIR descriptors. The H/I/S model is treated throughout as an operational measurement framework - anchored in primary sources in acoustics and psychoacoustics - rather than as a universal ontology of musical sound. The pipeline is designed for traceable, reproducible analysis at doctoral standard: every exported metric is accompanied by an epistemic contract, every numeric constant by a provenance class, and every methodological change by a versioned and tested phase entry in CHANGES.md.

## What this software does

SoundSpectrAnalyse analyses individual note recordings and produces a multi-sheet workbook of spectral, harmonic, inharmonic, sub-bass, and MIR descriptors per note, together with a corpus-level adaptive density profile. The pipeline runs in three stages:

1. **Stage 1 — per-note analysis** (`proc_audio.AudioProcessor`): STFT, peak picking, F0 estimation, harmonic / inharmonic / sub-bass (H/I/S) partitioning, stiff-string inharmonicity fit, sub-bass policy, MIR descriptors (spectral moments, tristimulus, Aures roughness, ERB-weighted density), and optional temporal segmentation. Output: one `spectral_analysis.xlsx` per note.
2. **Stage 2 — compilation** (`compile_metrics.compile_density_metrics_with_pca`): per-note rows aggregated into `compiled_density_metrics.xlsx` with tier-normalized columns, dissonance metrics, PCA scores, and validation summary.
3. **Stage 3 — research export + EWSD** (`post_compile_research_export` → `tools/export_research_density_workbook`): builds `compiled_density_metrics_research.xlsx` and recomputes **EWSD-R v18.1** from per-note component spectra. Merges EWSD scores with bootstrap CI, provenance fields, **`Stage3_Diagnostics`** (per-note), **`Stage3_Summary`** (run metadata), and fail-closed contract via `tools/ewsd_stage3_contract.py`.

An online adaptive engine (`adaptive_density_engine.AdaptiveDensityEngine`) learns a corpus-level (H, I, S) density profile across notes, using pure observations decoupled from the prior (Phase 1) and a Jensen-Shannon divergence reliability gate (Phase 7). The engine state is exported to `adaptive_density_engine_state.json` for reproducibility.

The full pipeline architecture and mathematical foundations are documented in [`docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL_COMPLETE.md`](docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL_COMPLETE.md).

## Theoretical anchoring

This software is the analytical instrument supporting the doctoral dissertation of Luís Raimundo (NOVA University of Lisbon, in preparation).

## Installation

The software is developed and tested on Python >=3.10,<3.12. Installation from a clean environment:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "SoundSpectrAnalyse"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### One-click installers (no Python required)

For non-technical users, platform-specific launchers are available under [`installers/`](installers/).  
These install a private runtime on first launch and then open the GUI directly:

- Windows 10/11: `installers\windows\Install and Run.bat`
- macOS: `installers/macos/Install and Run.command`
- Linux: `installers/linux/install-and-run.sh`

See [`installers/README.md`](installers/README.md) for step-by-step instructions.

Principal runtime dependencies (versions pinned in `pyproject.toml`):

- numerical: numpy, scipy, pandas, numba, scikit-learn
- audio / DSP: librosa, soundfile, pydub
- output: openpyxl, xlsxwriter
- visualisation: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- GUI: PyQt5 (legacy), tkinter (current Windows GUI is Tk-based and shipped with the standard library)

Optional development dependencies (testing, linting, type checking) are declared under `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The full module manifest (48 top-level modules) is declared under `[tool.setuptools] py-modules` in `pyproject.toml`. An installed wheel ships all scientific modules.

## Usage

### Cross-platform CLI

The canonical entry point is `run_orchestrator.py`, which runs the full Stage 1 + Stage 2 + Stage 3 pipeline on a folder of audio files:

```bash
python run_orchestrator.py
```

Equivalently, after installation:

```bash
soundspectranalyse
```

### Windows GUI

A Tk-based graphical orchestrator is available via `run.bat` on Windows, which launches `pipeline_orchestrator_gui.py`. The GUI provides per-stage progress reporting and adaptive-engine diagnostics.

## Outputs

For each input folder of audio files, the pipeline produces an `analysis_results/` directory containing:

| Artefact | Description |
|---|---|
| `<note_name>/spectral_analysis.xlsx` | Per-note multi-sheet workbook (spectrum, peaks, partitioning, descriptors). |
| `compiled_density_metrics.xlsx` | Corpus-level compiled workbook (16 sheets including `Density_Metrics`, `Canonical_Metrics`, `Diagnostic_Metrics`, `Validation_Metrics`, `PCA_*`, `Dissonance_Metrics`, `Analysis_Metadata`). |
| `compiled_density_metrics_research.xlsx` | Reduced research workbook. Includes **`note_effective_component_density`** (fatness), **`note_density_final`**, EWSD-R v18.1 with bootstrap CI, **`Primary_Statistics_Eligible`**, **`Stage3_Diagnostics`**, **`Stage3_Summary`**. Red **data bars** on **`EWSD_score_acoustic_balanced`**. All-blank columns are pruned at export (v4.0.2). Gate rows with `valid_for_primary_statistics == True`; gate EWSD with `ewsd_primary_analysis_eligible == True`. |

## Scientific governance

Methodological changes to the pipeline are tracked in [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md) with explicit phase markers (phases 1, 7, 7.1, 8, 11 at time of writing). Each phase change is accompanied by phase-organised regression tests under `tests/phase_<n>/`. Symbolic-structure tests for the canonical formulae are under [`tests/formula_validation/`](tests/formula_validation/) and documented in [`docs/validation/FORMULA_VALIDATION_STATUS.md`](docs/validation/FORMULA_VALIDATION_STATUS.md).

Principal methodological commitments:

- **FFT-length-aware normalization** (Phase 8). Peak-bin sums are normalized using `peak_amplitude_sum` (`N_ref/N`) or `peak_power_sum` (`(N_ref/N)²`) factors rather than broadband-L2 factors, eliminating the cross-tier discontinuity introduced by FFT-length tier switching. The empirical step discontinuity on a 1 kHz synthetic benchmark is reduced from approximately 29.9 % to approximately 0.87 %. See `CHANGES.md`, Phase 8 entry.
- **Prior / observation decoupling** (Phase 1). The triplet `pure_observation_w_{h,i,s}` carries the unmixed observation; the prior-smoothed values are retained as `smoothed_w_{h,i,s}_legacy` for backward compatibility only. This is a precondition for any defensible Bayesian update of the corpus-level profile.
- **Formula versioning** (Phase 7.1). `obs_w_formula_version = "v58_full_spectrum_region_energy_gate"` and `density_formula_version = "v5_apply_density_metric_adapted_v6_1"` are exported on every row, permitting cross-version comparability of compiled workbooks. The density energy gate uses the full-spectrum, total-power-normalised region triple (harmonic-peak / non-harmonic-residual / sub-bass); partial inharmonicity (coefficient B, inharmonic-peak energy) is reported separately and is not part of the density gate.
- **Per-metric epistemic contract** (`metric_contract.py`). Every exported density metric carries an explicit record of its formula, input domain, unit/scale, amplitude basis, power basis, normalization scope, physical interpretation, validity boundary, and ontological family.
- **Per-constant provenance registry** ([`docs/CONSTANTS_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/CONSTANTS_PROVENANCE.md)). Every numeric constant exported by `constants.py` is classified as `primary_source`, `derived`, `convention`, or `internal_default`. Internal defaults are tunable engineering choices documented for auditability rather than concealed.

The canonical bibliography for the theoretical anchors of the scientific modules is [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md). Inline `References` blocks in each scientific module cite from it in short form.
